after initializing the projetc you can run the projetc easily with "cmd /c start.bat"

To initialize environment

cd api
python3 -m venv venv OR
python -m venv venv

Activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Install flask
pip install Flask

Initialize react
cd client
npm install

These instructions may or may not work. I did not test them.
